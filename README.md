## Lines iOS Watch App

By Carl Gorringe <car1@gorringe.org>

This app demonstrates dynamically generated animations using *CoreGraphics* on an Apple Watch running WatchOS 2.0.

It's based on my first iOS app ***Lines!*** which was released to the App Store in Sept. 2010.  The plan is to update the app so that it'll work on the watch too.
